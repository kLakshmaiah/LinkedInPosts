# Discard Patterns (`_`) in C#

Ever come across the underscore (`_`) in C# and wondered what it does? It's not just a variable nameâ€”it's a **discard pattern** that helps write cleaner, more efficient code! ðŸš€

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Discard?

A **discard** (`_`) is a placeholder that tells the compiler, *"I'm intentionally ignoring this value."* It improves readability and avoids unnecessary variable allocations.

## ðŸ”¹ Introduced in C# 7.0

The discard pattern was introduced in **C# 7.0** and has since been enhanced in later versions.

## ðŸ”¹ Where Can You Use It?

Instead of creating a useless variable for `out`, we discard it!

### Deconstructing Tuples

We discard the middle values since we don't need them.

### Switch Expressions

Here, `_` acts as a default case for switch.

## ðŸš€ Why Use Discards?

- **âœ” Improves Readability**
- **âœ” Reduces Unnecessary Variables Usage**
- **âœ” Enhances Code Clarity**

Next time you see `_`, don't ignore itâ€”embrace it! ðŸ˜ƒ
